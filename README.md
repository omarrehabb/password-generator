# password-generator
This program generates secure passwords with tkinter GUI library.
## Details
### This password generator app is a graphical user interface (GUI) application built using the tkinter library in Python. It provides users with a simple interface to generate random passwords based on their specified requirements. Here's a description of the app's main features:
Password Criteria:
The app allows users to customize their password requirements using checkboxes. Users can choose from the following criteria:

Upper Case: Include uppercase letters (A-Z) in the generated passwords.
Lower Case: Include lowercase letters (a-z) in the generated passwords.
Numbers: Include digits (0-9) in the generated passwords.
Symbols: Include symbols like @, #, $, %, &, etc., in the generated passwords.
Number of Characters and Amount:
The app provides two input fields:

Number of Characters: Users can specify the desired length of each password by entering a number in this field.
Amount of Passwords: Users can specify how many passwords they want to generate at once.
Generate Passwords:
When the user clicks the "Generate passwords" button, the app uses the selected criteria and length to generate the specified number of random passwords. The passwords are displayed below the button in a scrollable text box.

Refresh and Error Handling:
The app uses a "refresh" approach to display new password lists each time the button is pressed, clearing the previous output. If the selected criteria do not provide enough characters to generate a password of the specified length, an error message is displayed to inform the user about the limitations.

Overall, this password generator app offers a straightforward and user-friendly way for users to create secure and random passwords that meet their specific requirements.
